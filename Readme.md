# Ride Sharing Analytics

## Project Overview

Ride Sharing Analytics is a C++ based project that simulates the analytics system of a ride-sharing platform such as Ola or Uber.

The project focuses on processing ride data and generating useful insights using Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Instead of simply storing ride information, the system performs various analytical operations such as revenue analysis, driver performance evaluation, ride filtering, surge pricing simulation, and fare-based searches.

The primary objective of the project is to understand how optimized algorithms can be used to efficiently process large datasets.
